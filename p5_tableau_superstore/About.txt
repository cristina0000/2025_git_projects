Note: for this project, load into pandas, explore and clean, put it in a SQLite database, and do more cleaning with SQL, put it back into a cleaned table, then to dataframe, then output, then take it to tableau public, then calculated field, parameters, lods, 
	table calcs, interactive, toolips with charts in them, maybe containers

Note: For a future project, normalize the file (split it into three files, orders, customers, and products)
start with that, load it into pandas (or normalize with SQL after loading), clean it, take it to tableau and use relationships to denormalize it, and then create sheets, dashboards, etc
